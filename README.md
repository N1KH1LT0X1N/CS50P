Welcome to my **CS50P** repository! This project contains my solutions, notes, and learning journey through Harvard University's [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) course.

## üìö About CS50P

CS50P is Harvard's introductory programming course that teaches the fundamentals of programming using Python. Through hands-on problem sets and projects, the course covers:

- **Functions, Variables** - Building blocks of programming
- **Conditionals** - Decision-making in code
- **Loops** - Iteration and repetition
- **Exceptions** - Error handling
- **Libraries** - Leveraging existing code
- **Unit Tests** - Ensuring code correctness
- **File I/O** - Reading and writing data
- **Regular Expressions** - Pattern matching
- **Object-Oriented Programming** - Structuring complex programs
- **Et Cetera** - Additional Python features and final project

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/N1KH1LT0X1N/CS50P.git
   cd CS50P
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run solutions:**
   Navigate to any problem set directory and run the Python script:
   ```bash
   cd week0/ps0/einstein
   python einstein.py
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   For problem sets with unit tests:
   ```bash
   cd week2/ps2/plates
   pytest test_plates.py
   ```

## üß™ Testing

This repository includes unit tests for several problem sets. To run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

To run tests for a specific problem:
```bash
pytest week2/ps2/plates/test_plates.py -v
```
